For this React Bingo Game to run properly, you need the following:

1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, inside your React project folder, run:

"npm install"

2️⃣ React Setup

If you haven't created a React app yet, create one using:

"npx create-react-app bingo-game"

"cd bingo-game"

Then, replace src/App.js with your code.

3️⃣ Tailwind CSS (Optional, for Styling)

You're using Tailwind classes (bg-gray-100, text-lg, etc.), so install Tailwind:

"npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer"

"npx tailwindcss init -p"

Then, add Tailwind to src/index.css or tailwind.config.js as per Tailwind setup.

4️⃣Run the App

Once everything is set up, start your React app:

"npm start"

Now your Bingo Game should run smoothly! 🎉 Let me know if you need any debugging help. 🚀

If you are facing an error called web-vitals not found after running your app

then you need to install the "web-vitals package"

"npm install web-vitals"
